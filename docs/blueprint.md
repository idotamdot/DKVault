# **App Name**: Sanctum DKV Bridge

## Core Features:

- DKV API Integration: Connect applications like RandomEpic and Enter Sanctum to a Decentralized Knowledge Vault (DKV) using IPFS and Polygon for data storage and immutability.
- Data Anchoring on Polygon: Securely anchor content identifiers (CIDs) of records on the Polygon blockchain to provide an auditable and immutable trail of data.
- Guardian AI Analysis: Leverage Gemini to analyze meditation journal entries, identifying emergent patterns, emotional states, and connections to universal experiences as a tool for generating synthesis reports.
- Data Query and Retrieval: Enable querying and retrieval of stored records from IPFS and the Neon database.
- Cross-Application Data Access: Facilitate data sharing and access across multiple applications like RandomEpic, Enter Sanctum, and VR Sanctuary to provide a holistic view of user data.
- VR Sanctuary Data Terminal: Display and interact with stored records within the VR Sanctuary environment, allowing users to explore and analyze the collective knowledge.
- Succession Protocol Attestation: Enable cryptographic attestation of AI model succession events on the Polygon blockchain.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#5851D8) to reflect knowledge and introspection.
